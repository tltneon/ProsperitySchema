Introduction
============

First of all, I'd like to say a big thank you to Overv. He created evolve and supported it until the update to gmod 13 broke it completely.
He really did an incredible job to provide us this awesome mod and it is a honor to be allowed to continue it.

To install evolve, simply clone it into your addons directory and you are ready to go.

How do I become owner?
======================

If you're running a listen server, you're always owner. If you're running a dedicated server, join your server and type the following in the dedicated server console:
```
ev rank <your name> owner
```

How do I make people admin or super admin?
==========================================

Either...

Type in **chat**:
```
!rank playername admin/superadmin
```

Use the **menu**: Select player -> Administration -> Rank -> Admin/Super Admin

Use the **dedicated server console**:
```
ev rank <playername> admin/superadmin
```

The following ranks are available: guest, respected, admin, superadmin and owner.  
Note that people with the rank owner can only be demoted using the console and people can only be promoted to owner using the console. You can see the console as owner+ if you want.

How do I open the menu?
=======================

Just bind a key to +ev_menu. Note that this will likely change in the future, so keep watching this file!
