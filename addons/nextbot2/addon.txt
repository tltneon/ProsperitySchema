You can generate one for a map by typing in the following commands:  "nav_quicksave 1" then "nav_generate" and then "nav_save"   Depending on the size and complexity of the map it can take from several seconds to several minutes. If the zombie is standing in place that means there is no navigation mesh.   [h1] No walkable seed positions [/h1] If "nav_generate" gives you a message saying "No walkable seed positions" then type in:  "nav_edit 1" then point into spots on the map and type "nav_mark_walkable" once you're done you can then type in "nav_quicksave 1" then "nav_generate"   [h1] Features: [/h1] - Nextbot AI - Good performance - Attacks NPCs and NPCs attack them - Special abilites for each zombie  - Targets in a line of sight and will not see past walls - Advanced targetting - Death animations  - Variety of zombies - Boss zombies - Custom sounds, models, etc - Realistic movement, zombies start off slow and then accelerate - No requirements, all you need is in this addon  [h1] Commands: [/h1] - "nb_stop 1" = Stop all nextbots - "nb_stop 0" = Start all nextbots - "nb_npc 1" = Activate npc targetting - "nb_npc 0" = Disable npc targetting - "nb_attackprop 1" Activate prop/door attacking - "nb_attackprop 0" Disable prop/door attacking - "ai_ignoreplayers 1" Nextbots ignore players - "ai_ignoreplayers 0" Nextbots don't ignore players  [h1] Addons that work well with this: [/h1] - [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346585225] Simple Prop Damage [/url]  - [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=179517028] Dynamic Zombie Spawning [/url]   [h1] Additional Nextbots: [/h1] - [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=384669784] Fleshpound NextBot [/url] - [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=386694181&tscn=1423304984] L4D Tank NextBot [/url] - [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=397547361] Spooky Skeleton NextBots [/url] - [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=296806391] Zombie Survival NextBots 2.0 [/url]  [h1] Credits: [/h1] - All skins, models and sounds are not mine.
