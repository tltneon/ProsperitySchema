Once I find a fix I will add it back in.   These are new, smart and advanced zombies with lots of features. They're located in the NextBot Zombies category in the NPCs tab.   [b][h1]HOW TO USE[/h1][/b] These zombies require a map with a nav mesh to work, you can tell if a map doesn't have one if the zombies sit there idle not doing anything. Most maps don't have a nav mesh so you can just generate one by typing the following commands into the console,  "nav_quicksave 1" then "nav_generate" (nav_generate could take a few seconds to several minutes depending on the size of the map and how complex it is, you're game will be laggy during this)   You'll reconnect back to the game once it's finished, you can save the nav mesh so you don't have to generate it again by typing in "nav_save"   [h1]Features:[/h1] - Lots of different types of zombies - Some zombies have death animations - Strong performance - Falling - Attacking while moving - Foot step sounds - Breaking down doors - Attacking props and flinging them - Attacking players - Can move around maps easily (depending on the map) - Unique abilities for each zombie - Unique animations - Chance to flinch - Splatter blood on nearby surfaces - Custom spawnicons for each zombie - A kill icon for each zombie - Sounds like death sounds, idle sounds, attack sounds, etc.  [h1]Commands:[/h1] - "nb_stop 1" = Stop all nextbots. - "nb_stop 0" = Start all nextbots. - "nb_delete_all" = Remove all nextbots.
