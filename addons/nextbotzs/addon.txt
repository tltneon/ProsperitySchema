The Zombies are located in the Zombie Survival NextBots category.   [h1] [b] HOW TO USE [/b] [/h1] Since these zombies use the nextbot AI they still require a nav mesh like my NextBot Zombies, some maps on the workshop have nav meshes already included but most don't. This is why you can generate one by typing in "nav_quicksave 1" then "nav_generate".   Depending on the map you're on it can take a minute to several minutes. Once it's done your game will restart and there will be a nav mesh, you can save the nav mesh by typing in "nav_save".  You can check if a map doesn't have a nav mesh if the zombies just stand there idle doing nothing.  [h1] Features: [/h1] - Giga Gore Child Boss - Gore Child - Nightmare - Bloated Zombie - PukePus - Tickle Monster - Butcher - Fast Zombie - Flesh Fire (from Fearsome Gaming)  - A menu of customizable options for every zombie - Attacking while moving - Very good performance, you can have alot of zombies in a game at once (depending on your computer and how many addons you have) - Blood particles - Knockback - Attacking props - Breaking down doors - Unique abilites - Unique spawnicons - Kill icons - Sounds  [h1] Commands: [/h1] - "nb_stop 1" Stop all nextbots - "nb_stop 0" Start all nextbots - 'nb_delete_all" Remove all nextbots  [h1] Credits: [/h1] - DrVrej for Customizable Options code and spawner code - Vinrax for making the doll a player model - Jetboom for zombie survival"
