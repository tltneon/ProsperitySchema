You can generate one for a map by typing in the following commands:  "nav_quicksave 1" then "nav_generate" and then "nav_save"   Depending on the size and complexity of the map it can take from several seconds to several minutes. If the zombie is standing in place that means there is no navigation mesh.   [h1] No walkable seed positions [/h1] If "nav_generate" gives you a message saying "No walkable seed positions" then type in:  "nav_edit 1" then point into spots on the map and type "nav_mark_walkable" once you're done you can then type in "nav_quicksave 1" then "nav_generate"   [h1] Features: [/h1] - Nextbot AI - Uses my NextBot Zombies 2.0 base - Attacks NPCs and NPCs attack them  - Targets in a line of sight and will not see past walls  - Advanced targetting  - Death animations   - Good performance - No custom models or sounds, uses skeleton player model - Color varations - Scary and fun to play with  [h1] Commands: [/h1] - "nb_stop 1" = Stop all nextbots - "nb_stop 0" = Start all nextbots - "nb_npc 1" = Activate npc targetting - "nb_npc 0" = Disable npc targetting - "nb_attackprop 1" Activate prop/door attacking - "nb_attackprop 0" Disable prop/door attacking - "ai_ignoreplayers 1" Nextbots ignore players - "ai_ignoreplayers 0" Nextbots don't ignore players  [h1] Addons that work well with this: [/h1] - [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346585225] Simple Prop Damage [/url]  - [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=179517028] Dynamic Zombie Spawning [/url]   [h1] Make sure to read the description before commenting.
