## Introduction
NutScript 1.1 is the re-working of the original NutScript framework to provide a better back-end. This should include more efficient code and overall benefits to the way the framework functioned and/or performed.

## Important Notes
* A .sql file is not provided since the tables should be generated for you.
* The style has changed to use lowerCamelCase (most of the time) so be aware of casing!
* **This is NOT finished and ready for __public__ use. Changes could occur at any time.**
* You can find more changes under changes.txt

## Documentation
* Since the wiki was accidently wiped (my bad), I'll just use the wiki included with Git if it is suitable.
