		<p align="center"><font color='red' size='6'>Prosperity</font></p><br/>
		<font color='white' size='3'>In the schema of Prosperity
		you roleplay a survivor of the apocalypse, an apocalypse
		caused by disturbing and mysterious forces.<br/><br/>
			
			This catastrophic event occurred approximately , March 18, 2015.
		and humanity has not recovered in the slightest, the world is filled
		with the confused and lost remnants of humnity who do not know the extent
		of the destruction.<br/><br/>
		
			The new world is filled with creatures of various shapes and sizes.
		Each type of creature has its own abilities, tactics, and ways of life.
		Many are quite hostile, while others simply avoid humanity. Creatures of
		the new world are not something to underestimate, and are not something
		to fight without a plan. Your life is in your own hands, only you are 
		truly able to protect it.<br/><br/>
		
			The world around you is made for your own discovery, for you to 
		piece together the world, its mysterious and its new dangers. This
		allows for a fair amount of interesting roleplay to take place, and
		it is important to not run headfirst into the darkness if you want
		to survive.<br/><br/>
	
			Remember, if you're truly lost, asking an admin for assistance
		or looking on the forums may help you, you can use @ or /admin to
		send a message to the admin chat.<br/><br/>
