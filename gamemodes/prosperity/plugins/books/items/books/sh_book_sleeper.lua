		<font color='white' size='3'>The sleeper is the initial
		character type for those joining the server in its earlier
		stages.<br/><br/>
			
			What sets the Sleeper apart from a regular survivor, is his/her
		complete lack of memories of the apocalyptic events leading to where
		the world is now. Their memories tell them they went to sleep one day,
		and awoke in the basement of a dark facility. Surrounded by others,
		similar to themselves, they try to understand their peculiar, and possibly
		grim situation.<br/><br/>
		
			Sleepers are somewhat ungroomed, as they have been asleep for quite
		some time, their hair is overgrown, their bodies are not clean by any means.
		None would have any strange new injuries, and each would appear to have 
		been well fed in their slumber. The clothes they wear are remnants of the
		past, the clothes they were wearing when they went to sleep before they
		awoke.<br/><br/>
		
			Sleepers, upon awakening, are not armed with any weapons. They 
		would however, still have trinkets and other small objects, such as 
		uncharged phones, ipods, and wallets. If you wish to ask for an
		authorization, it is best to ask an admin or post on the forums.
		A forums post is recommend if the authorization you wish for is of
		significant value.<br/><br/>
		
			Remember, if you're truly lost, asking an admin for assistance
		or looking on the forums may help you, you can use @ or /admin to
		send a message to the admin chat.<br/><br/>
