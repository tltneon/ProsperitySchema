		<font color='white' size='3'>The survivor is a fairly general
		and somewhat basic character. A survivor is simply someone who
		has survived through the days of the initial attacks. You would
		distinctly remember the day, March 18, 2015.<br/><br/>
			
			You have a bit of freedom regarding the backstory around how you
		survived, where you lived, and potentially how you got to where you are
		currently. Essentially, if you were living in a big city, you would have
		seen titanic monsters destroying buildings, the sky filled with masses of
		flesh, droves of horrors in the streets. Surviving from something of this
		sort is more luck than skill.<br/><br/>
		
			Those from smaller towns or more rural areas, would have seen less giant
		monsters, but more fast, ransacking beings. Such beings would be fairly
		organized, and would rip through towns, seemingly focused on annihilating those
		living there as fast as possible. Those who fought back were usually able
		to make a stand, but ultimately the attacks were unexpected, and few were
		prepared for such an offensive. People who survive from these situations
		are usually those who hid themselves away, or ran from the terror into the
		woods or elsewhere.<br/><br/>
		
			Remember that your character has recently survived a very traumatic
		event, and may not fully understand exactly what happened. Be sure to
		properly RP any injuries that your character may have gotten from the 
		event. Along with that, the appearance of your character should reflect
		some of what he has been through, ripped or torn clothing, unwashed face,
		etc. A survivor character may seem bland or ordinary, but it is within your
		ability to give your character a story to tell.<br/><br/>

		or looking on the forums may help you, you can use @ or /admin to
